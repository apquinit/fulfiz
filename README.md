# Fulfiz

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/apquinit/fulfiz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/apquinit/fulfiz)


Fulfiz is a micro-framework for building Dialogflow fulfillments with expressive, elegant syntax. This framework attempts to take the pain out in developing a Dialogflow agent that is designed to handle multiple fulfillment services.

Fulfiz allows you to connect natural language understanding and processing to your own systems, APIs, and databases. Using Fulfiz, you can surface commands and information from your services to your users through a natural conversational interface.

Fulfiz makes creating fulfillment for Dialogflow agents easy and simple.
